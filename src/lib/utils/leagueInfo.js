  <p> In 2019 a new fantasy football league was birthed out of the visionary mind of Brandon (aka Big Daddy Dinosaur Eggs). The charter group of managers consisted of 10 friends, most of whom had never experienced the 365 day grind of a Dynasty Fantasy Football league. </p>
  <p> We have witnessed many trials and triumphs during this league's young history; capable new owners have transformed once-orphaned rosters into contenders, franchise players have been passed around like diseases in a whore-house, and many a trade has resulted in instant regret. </p>
   <p> But alas, despite the changes and the passing of time, one constant remains: we ALL continue to fight to be the next to firmly grasp the shiny, vascular trophy at the end of each season. </p>
   <p> This is... </p>

I manage between 5-9 fantasy rosters in any given season, although my entry into this league certainly receives the lion's share of my time and attention. While I tend to form deep (almost personal) relationships with each of my Dynasty players, I have been known to offer many of them up in questionable trades after a few weeknight whiskeys. As one of the founding owners, I am proud to see how far the league has come -- after a quiet inaugural season, it is now commonplace to see a blockbuster trade hit at 9:30 pm on a random Wednesday in March. I get to compete and interact with some of my best pals and a brother-in-law for 365 days a year...and as a 30 year old father living in an apartment with all females, this league is an oasis for me.
